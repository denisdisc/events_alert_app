# events_alert_app

Have you ever wanted to go to Python Meetup or some conferencies, but realized it was last week? Maybe there was a free concerts in your area on data science or big data and you missed out because you forgot to check.

You can customize the system to work the way you want, and maybe even allow other people to make their own alerts by making this a website. Try it and you will keep in touch with your most favorite events.
